This is a clean and simple starter repo using the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) in [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)!

## Objective

Integrating an existing T3 project in Tauri is pretty easy. The problem arises when we scaffold a new app using `create tauri-app`. Instead of trying to stitch together the T3 Stack tech from scratch, we can simply use this template.

## Commands

### Install Deps

```sh
npm i
```

### Run Dev 

```sh
npm run tauri dev
```

### Build App

```sh
npm run tauri build
```

Don't like `npm`? Feel free to use `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `cargo`. Nothing will break!
